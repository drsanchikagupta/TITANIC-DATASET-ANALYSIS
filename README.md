# TITANIC-DATASET-ANALYSIS

In the titanic dataset training.ipynb tried to answer some basic questions using analysis and visualization tools. Used matplotlib and seaborn libraries for the same. Also used python numpy and pandas library for computation on arrays and using in memory data frames respectively.
Questions to which answers have been provided using visualization of data:
1.) Who were the passengers on the Titanic? (Ages,Gender,Class,..etc)
2.) What deck were the passengers on and how does that relate to their class?
3.) Where did the passengers come from?
4.) Who was alone and who was with family?
5.) What factors helped someone survive the sinking?

In the Titanic_LogisticRegression ipython notebook, I applied the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy. I used logisticRegression to solve the problem and got an accuracy of 75.56%.
